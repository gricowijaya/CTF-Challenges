PRE-Exercises
=============

01. Introduction

I recently started reading <a href="http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118787315.html" target="_blank">Practical Reverse Engineering: x86, x64, ARM, Windows Kernel, Reversing Tools, and Obfuscation</a>; ISBN: 978-1-118-78731-1

The book contains number of exercises and the authors encourage people to share their solutions. 

This project contains my solutions - write-ups and source code. 
I am also planning to post the solutions at my blog on <a href="http://wwww.dailysecurity.net" target="_blank">http://wwww.dailysecurity.net</a>
I will be using it also to track my progress :)

If you have any comments - let me know.

Enjoy!
