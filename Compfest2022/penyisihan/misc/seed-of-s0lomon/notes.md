s0lomon is a land of magik, located off-shore, near Dale Nation. Every trespasser who steps on S0lomon's soil has to pass the "test" from the s0lomon queen, Nadenka; otherwise, they'll be transported to random places. When he went on his pilgrimage, Ngab stopped by s0lomon land because he was intrigued by the queen, Nadenka. Long short story, Ngab met Nadenka, and his first impression was this queen is unreasonably cold and harsh, though she is a beauty. For the test, Nadenka says,

    "O', trespassers of s0lomon, the seed of s0lomon has been reaped. Those who seek the truth shall parse till the end. If you've found what I want, meet me at dusk and beg for benevolence on the gate of s0lomon. If you choose the wrong gate, the punishment shall befall you. remember, remember."

It was an interesting riddle for Ngab. He enjoyed it as if it were his last. Just before dawn rose, Ngab successfully solved the riddle and was able to leave s0lomon land with rewards from the queen. "Heh, so that's what the queen wanted. I guess the queen is also a normal human being", said Ngab with a big smile.
