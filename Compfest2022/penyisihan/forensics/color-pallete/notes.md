Visual design team already brainstorming for theme of Colorfest event, which is "dominance in art". But they still discuss for choosing 5 color to their color pallete, can you help them?

Flag format : COMPFEST14{flag}

#1 Sorted by dominance visually
#2 If a color do not have specific wavelengths, then it is not a color, 
  but still useful when it is needed. Remember the logo of Colorfest is pink, so it must be used in color palette.
#3 Hex to base64
